Alright, 14 original lines.
14 Madlib lines.
Okay, I'll work on removing duplicates later.
What I'm thinking is that I should change the replacement names
in the original poem and search string, so there can be no possible
overlap. Such as a verb replacing an adverb, because the string search method
explicitly search for only the word, but anything with the search word in it.
Should be easy now that the code is done.
