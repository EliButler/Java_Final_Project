Okay, so I finally figured out the file system. It seems there is a big difference
between java 1.8, which I was using and Java 14, which I am now using.
So I think I'll use the updated system with a scanner and if that fails,
just use a built in arrayList.

Code complete!

If this is to be used by anyone else, I'll have to remove the Main method, otherwise it works
well as it is.
